<p><b>GrowHome Calc</b> is a tool for aspiring home growers, urban gardeners, and sustainability advocates. It helps you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Estimate cost and yield of indoor leafy green hydroponic systems</li>
  <li>Compare the cost-effectiveness of growing food at home vs. store-bought</li>
  <li>Design your ideal home setup with rack, tray, and equipment options</li>
  <li>Track breakeven timelines and sustainability metrics</li>
</ul>

<p>This project was built to make resilient food systems more accessible to everyone â€” from students and families to future climate entrepreneurs.</p>
